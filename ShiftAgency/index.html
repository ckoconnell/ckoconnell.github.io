      <p>Greetings Shift Team,
      <p>My name is Chris O’Connell and I’d love to be considered for your Web Developer position. I’m a recent transplant to Victoria, mainly continuing my freelance work, but am hoping to find a good fit with a local company to which I could be of value.
      <p>Based on the description provided things look promising: Self-professed nerd? Check. The ability to set macro priorities with respect to project management while getting my hands dirty authoring efficient code? That’s my wheelhouse.
      <p>Specific to the position requirements and responsibilities, I am fully fluent in mobile-first HTML & CSS/SASS and have extensive experience with WordPress - it’s my go-to platform for CMS-based projects and I’m comfortable tweaking existing themes or creating them from scratch. The most relevant examples of custom WordPress work would be my redesign of the <a href="http://blog.arcteryx.com" target="_blank">Arc’teryx Blog</a>, and the website for film series <a href="http://www.askiersjourney.com" target="_blank">A Skier’s Journey</a>. </p>
      <p>Beyond coding, my design skills include fluency with the Adobe Creative Suite, various UX tools like Sketch, and most recently 3D asset creation workflows with Blender and Substance Painter. With regards to the digital marketing items listed, I have familiarity with Google Analytics, e-commerce KPI tracking & reporting, as well as customer capture and retention programs via e-mail and social media. </p>
      <p>If it sounds like I might be a potential fit, please don’t hesitate to contact me for any further examples of work, references, or just to chat about my general suitability.</p>
      <p>You can view my online resume by clicking the link below.</p>
      <p>Thanks again for your time and have a great day,</p>
      <p>Chris</p>
