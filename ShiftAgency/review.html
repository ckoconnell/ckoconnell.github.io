      <p>HBO’s most memorable foray into the Western genre takes viewers to 1870s South Dakota and the town of Deadwood, one of any number of lawless outposts of the era built on gold mining and men running away from their problems.</p>
      <p>With just enough historical grounding to invoke a few famous names from the past, Deadwood follows mostly familiar tropes and while it doesn’t necessarily break any new ground, the freedom of the HBO format - now commonplace - provides at least the oppourtunity for substantial character development. Not that anyone should get too attached to any particular character living in a world of revenge killings and all-liquor diets.</p>
      <p>Deadwood - the town and the show - are anchored by Ian McShane’s Al Swearengen who takes Tony Soprano-like purview over his self-designated domain, and does so quite convincingly. We only get a handful of other meaningful storylines but strong performances almost across the board do help to foster some compassion for the characters in spite of many of the truly wretched things they’re regularly responsible for. </p>

      <p>This tight focus on a small core group of characters mostly works, but it does present a few challenges to the viewer. Essentially only exposed to a couple of buildings on the town’s main street it’s downright jarring to suddenly see, for example, a sprawling Chinese section of town seven episodes into the season. </p>
      <p>And while the editing and camerawork are consistent with this type of slow-reveal - an almost complete lack of establishing shots, and tight high-focal length shots for everything - this format has does have its upsides. There’s a very strong mix of writers throughout the entire first season and the variety of perspectives explored while maintaining character consistency is to be commended.</p>
      <p>Deadwood’s debut season is worth a watch. It may not bring anything new to the table in terms of filmmaking or storytelling but the performances do warrant some attention even a decade after it’s launch. You might even get a few new cuss words in your vocabulary.</p>
