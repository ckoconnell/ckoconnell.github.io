      <p>Greetings Flytographer,</p>
			<p>My name is Chris O’Connell and I’d love to be considered for your Digital Content Manager position. I’m a recent transplant to Victoria, currently continuing my freelance work, but am hoping to find a good fit with a local company to which I could be of value.</p>
			<p>My skillset and experience is quite varied, but much of it is relevant to the role as it's been outlined, as well as the company itself. Having worked in the print and digital spaces on both the editorial and brand fronts, I have a holistic perspective on how and why brands should leverage content strategy to acheive their goals. In addition, my experience in content creation and passion for photography give me the sense that this could be a good match.</p>
			<p>Below you'll find links to my online resume with an overview of my work history and projects I've been workng on recently. I've also compiled a selection of visuals that will hopefully provide a sense of my creative aesthetic and a few concrete examples of relevant work.</p>
			<p>If it sounds like I might be a potential fit, please don’t hesitate to contact me for any further examples, references, or just to chat about my general suitability.</p>
			<p>Thanks for your time and have a great day,</p>
			<p>Chris</p>
