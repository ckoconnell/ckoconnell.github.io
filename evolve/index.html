      <p>Good Day Evolve PR Team,</p>
			<p>My name is Chris O'Connell and I would love to be considered for your Social Media and Community Coordinator position. I've recently relocated to Victoria and am looking to find a good fit with a solid team while I continue my freelance work.</p>
			<p>I have an extensive and varied skill set that touches on all of your key requirements - creating, executing and analyzing multi-channel campaigns, content creation across digital and print, and stellar organizational skills - but what's most exciting to me is the potential to flex my creative muscles on a variety of projects with passionate communities on a day-to-day basis.</p>
			<p>With regards to the gaming space, I'm a life-long gamer that started out on the Atari 2600, went to Nintendo from the NES through N64, had a brief fling with Sony and the Playstation 1, and then transitioned to Xbox. After four(!) Red Rings of Death on the 360 I am now happily PC gaming. I currently have 978 hours into Ubisoft's The Division (Uplay tag Ath1337ic if anyone wants to run some Legendary missions) and work to contribute to the thriving community on reddit. </p>
			<p>If you'd like any further details I'd be more than happy to provide relevant samples of work or anything else you might like to see. In the meantime, there are two links below, one to my resume that includes a summary of my work experience and recent projects, as well as a visuals page that showcases my content creation work. Take a look a let me know if you think I might be a suitable fit to help with your on-going goal of not sucking.</p>
			<p>Thank you for your time and consideration,</p>
			<p>Chris</p>
