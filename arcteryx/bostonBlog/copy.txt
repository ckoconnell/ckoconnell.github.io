<p>Boston is no stranger to snow, but there are a handful of landmark events that have brought the city to its knees and the smiles to skiers faces. Here is a roundup of the worst (or best, depending on your perspective) recorded snowfalls so that we all know what to expect from the coming months.</p>

<h3>1. 19.4 inches, February 1958</h3>
<p>This may not seem like a lot of snow, but know that this was the second of two huge snowstorms to hit Boston in the same month. The buildup of snow without time to react forced the city to a standstill. All in all, the storm is said to have caused 43 deaths and millions of dollars in damages…that’s a lot of money in 1958.</p>

<h3>2. 19.8 inches, March 1960</h3>
<p>This storm rocked the entire east coast, including dumping 31.3 inches on poor little Nantucket. Boston was hit pretty hard, and quickly, bringing all traffic, road and rail, to a grinding halt.</p>

<h3>3. 21.4 inches, January 1978</h3>
<p>You may be thinking, “Oh yeah, I’ve heard of the Blizzard of ‘78,” but, no, this is actually the other blizzard of 1978. This earlier storm wasn’t quite as intense, but it blanketed the city and made any cleanup once that famous February storm hit nearly impossible. Boston was kicked when it was already down, but more on that later.</p>

<h3>4. 22.5 inches, January 2005</h3>
<p>This benevolent storm occurred on a weekend, so it didn’t impact businesses or schools too much (sorry kids), but did cause quite a lot of damage. The winds that weekend were particularly strong, some clocking around 80 mph, and blew snow into towering, impassable drifts.</p>

<h3>5. 25.4 inches, April 1997</h3>
<p>April Fools! But seriously, this blizzard was no joke. Come April 1st, 1997, Boston was covered in more snow than it had had all winter. And with the date being so late in the year, most people didn’t take the forecast too seriously. The plows had been put away, restaurants were starting to put out patio furniture, and then....”Mother Nature’s April Fools’ Joke.”</p>

<h3>6. 26.3 inches, February 1969</h3>
<p>This blizzard is notable for its duration, and, unfortunately, its death count. It snowed for 101 consecutive hours (a record), and is blamed for 94 deaths mainly due to slow response and poor forecasting.</p>

<h3>7. 27.1 inches, February 1978</h3>
<p>OK, this is the real Blizzard of 1978 (see above), and it was a doozy. Not only was it intense and severe, but it followed on the tails of another record-breaking blizzard not three weeks before. Most of what fell in January was still on the ground when this, now infamous, Blizzard of ‘78 came to town. The city was at a standstill for days. In typical understated fashion, CBS’ Harvey Leonard went on air at 7:30am to tell Bostonians, “We are going to get hit hard.” Hard was right.</p>

<h3>8. 27.5 inches, February 2003</h3>
<p>While this storm holds the record for the most snowfall in a 24-hour period, it still doesn’t hold a candle to the impact of 1978’s storm. The snow on this President’s Day Weekend was dry, manageable, and cleanup was well organized and quick. People were flocking to the ski resorts because the powder was perfect and school was canceled.</p>

<p>To put things in perspective a little, last winter’s biggest storm in January 2015, aka Snowmageddon, dropped 24.6 inches of snow on an already snowy Boston. Just before the storm hit Eleanor Vallier-Talbot of the weather service said, “Right now it looks like a light storm, but any snow on top of what we already have is crazy.” And crazy it was. Though that blizzard froze the metro area, both literally and figuratively, know that it could be worse (because it has been worse). This winter is supposedly going to be warmer than last, but who’s to say? You can’t trust anything these days, least of all the weather. Your best bet? Layer up.</p>
