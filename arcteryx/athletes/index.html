        <p>Growing up in a family full of climbers, Vikki took to climbing at a young age and was soon excelling in the climbing gym and competitions. Her drive and determination led her to seven consecutive national championship titles and the opportunity to represent Canada at six Youth World Cup events, with her best result placing 5th in Beijing 2006. In the bouldering arena, Vikki has earned three Open National victories and multiple podium finishes.</p>
        <p>Growing up in Calgary, close to some of Canada's best sport climbing, Vikki quickly discovered the joy of climbing outdoors. Her addiction to the rock and a willingness to push personal limits led to quick successes. Vikki climbed her first 13a at the age of 15 and has since redpointed multiple 13d's (8b) and bouldered up to V10.</p>
        <p>In the future, Vikki is eager to continue to push her limits in difficult routes, as well as to explore new avenues in the world of climbing. With her newfound appetites for difficult multi-pitches and traditional crack climbing, Vikki is sure her love and enjoyment of the sport will never run dry.</p>
