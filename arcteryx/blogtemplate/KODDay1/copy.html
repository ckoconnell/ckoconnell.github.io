<h1>KING OF DOLOMITES: FIRST DAY</h1>
<p>The freeride photography competition started with a day of mixed weather, positive minds and motivated teams vying for the crown of the 2016 Arc´teryx King of Dolomites.</p>
<p>Day One is over and the first pictures are taken. Eight professional and 40 amateur teams woke up with bright blue sky that slowly became overcast, then turned super foggy but ended with clear skies and spectacular light. Nice conditions to get the best shot for one of the new categories. As explained by organizer Filippo Ongaro at the Riders Meeting Thursday (the night before the competition began) the rules of the 4th edition changed and now teams can proof their skills and creativity in the four categories landscape, action, alpine and KOD 2016 story line.</p>
<p>The tranquil area of San Martino di Castrozza, which is nestled in the Italian Dolomites offers a variety of landscapes from open snow fields around the Passo Rolle, the dramatic mountain peaks forests of the Tognola, and the alpine area of the Rosetta. Most of them came back to town happy to get the first shots done and are looking forward to a sunny Saturday – or for the upcoming clear night with a bright and almost full moon.</p>
