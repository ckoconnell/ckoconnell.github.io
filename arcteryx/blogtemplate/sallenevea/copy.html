<p>At first sight, it might seem not very obvious to still find alpine powder stash, when the 3 letters of the www prefix is all you need to dial, to instantly get the universal knowledge at the tips of your 10 fingers. Is the “secret spot”, the rider’s Holy Grail, that lost powder hole that only few people have information, is becoming a scarce, depleted in a share-and-like vortex? Everything seems to have been seen, done and now subject to rarity. Well almost, because luckily there will be always adventure to be started right at your doorstep, if you’re staring at the right direction, willing to get it and if incidentally you're having a pair of skis strapped on your rooftop.</p>
<p>This first half of winter, we’ve been cursed by either rollercoaster temperatures or strong winds, but with positive attitude, there’s always income to be made out of adversity. Alps are blanketed with lifts system and huts to fill the gaps in between. You can get blinded by the lights of shiny big snow field resorts, or look closely at the maps to find gems that have been left over by the hype. It gave me the chance to explore new neighbors territories, 8 hours drive distant from my Engelberg winter home. After having crossed 3 countries (Swiss, Austria, Liechtenstein) we finally reached Sella Nevea.</p>
<p>Sella Nevea is a pocket size Italian ski center located in the Julian’s Alps, featuring 3 lifts, 1 pizzeria and a handful of dull concrete buildings. From the almost empty car park, at a modest elevation of 1050m, the orange cabins of a gondola laid us 1000m further up, where a cable car took us to the final step, at 2400m right on the Slovenian boarder. Once the super easy accessible and fun ridge line has been milked out, with the concourse of rare locals, the best is still to come, with the help of our climbing skins and a little sweat. Anything around this 360° snow circus is reachable within a range of 30mn to 2h hike, offering great rides, from couloirs to big open faces. If you’re really greedy, there's twice more to do if you go explore further the back drop faces.</p>
<p>Sella Nevae’s terrain will not let your body unmoved, but will give you tired legs and a wide smile across the face. And if possibly our mood got gloomy after a total white out day, we just had to let or skis slide down to the refugio Gilberti.  7 years ago, Irene and her boyfriend Paolo, the refuge keepers, fell in love for this ancient stone building.  Great hosts and lovely humans, they will warm up our spirit with their cheerful presence and fill up bellies with tasteful local dishes. After having checked some of the brightest night sky that the Milky Way has to offer and before heading under the rooftop dormitory to get some rest, at the bar Irene offers us a “zuccherino” : a sugar that has dipped in a special blend of alpine herbs and 90° alcohol! She’s watching amused our funny faces engendered by the powerful treat before eventually joining the degustation. As she says :“One for each eye”.</p>



<p>Having instant access to universal knowledge at the tips of our 10 fingers, by dialing the 3 letters of the www prefix, has for sure spoiled a few hidden powder holes, by throwing them in the share-and-like vortex. Everything seems to have been seen, done and now subject to rarity. But luckily there will be always adventure to be start right at our doorstep, by staring at the right direction, willing to get it and if incidentally having a pair of skis strapped on the rooftop.</p>

<p>The first half of the winter, the Alps have been cursed with both rollercoaster temperatures and persistent winds that have scattered the snow away. If ski-bumming life taught me one thing, it would be that there’s always an income to be made out of adversity, like discovering new places and people. You can get blinded by the lights of shiny big snow field resorts, or take a closer look at the maps to find left over gems. In this vast playground blanketed with lifts system and huts that fill the gaps in between, that are called Alps, for sure there always will be a place to find deeper snow. </p>

<p>Sella Nevea is a pocket- size Italian ski center only a couple km away from Austria, located in the Julian’s Alps, featuring 3 lifts, 1 pizzeria and a handful of dully grey buildings. From the almost empty car park, at a modest 1050m elevation, the bright orange cabins of a gondola took us upon a wide forest 1000m further up, where a cable-car carried us on the final step, a 2400m high ridge, right on the Slovenian boarder. Once the ridiculously easily accessible and hundreds meters long mini-golf line has been milked out, with the concourse of rare locals, the best is still to come, with the help of our climbing skins and a little sweat. Anything around this 360° snow circus is reachable within a range of 30mn to 2h hike, offering great rides, from couloirs to big open faces. And if you can’t get enough, there's still twice more to explore by exploring the back drops. </p>

<p>Sella Nevae’s terrain will not let our body unmoved, but will leave us tired legs and a wide smile across the face. And if possibly our mood got gloomy after a total white out day, we just had to let our skis glide down towards the refuge Gilberti, in the center of the system.  The refuge keepers, Irene and her boyfriend Paolo, fell in love for this ancient stone housing,  7 years ago.  They’re the best hosts we could imagine and both lovely humans, whom will warm up our spirit with their cheerful presence and fill up bellies with awesome local dishes. After having checked some of the brightest night sky that the Milky Way has to offer and before heading under the rooftop dormitory to get some rest, at the bar Irene never missed a chance to offer us a “zuccherino”: a sugar that has dipped in a jar with a blend of alpine herbs and 95° alcohol! She watches amused our funny faces, grimed by the powerful treat, before eventually joining the degustation. As she would says :“One for each eye”.</p>
