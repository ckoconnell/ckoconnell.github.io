<h1>The Arc´teryx Alpine Academy returns to Chamonix</h1>

Words by Kathi Habermann.

<p>After four successful editions of the event, the Arc'teryx Alpine Academy is returning to Chamonix-Mont-Blanc June 16-19, 2016. Alpine enthusiasts, mountain guides and professional athletes will gather with the aim of creating a space where beginners and experts alike can gain alpine knowledge through clinics, experience sharing and respect for the alpine environment.</p>

<p>Registration starts on Tuesday, March 15th on  http://chamonix.arcteryxacademy.com/</p>

<p>Clean Up on Thursday!</p>

<p>The four-day-event will begin on Thursday, June 16 with the Mountain Clean-up. Participants will join certified mountains guides and over 20 international Arc´teryx athletes to collect rubbish from the mountain. This initiative is a collaboration between the Arc'teryx Alpine Academy and the Compagnie du Mont-Blanc (CMB) with the goal to help keep our mountains pure.</p>

<p>The Mountain Clean-up is followed by three clinic days on the mountain and seminars, a movie night and an Academy dinner. All of the workshops will be led by professional mountain guides from the ‘Compagnie des Guides de Chamonix’, the ‘British Mountain Guides’ (BMG), Chamex Guides and Arc´teryx Pro Athletes like Ines Papert, Luka Lindič, Stian Hagen and many more.</p>

<p>Three new clinics will be on the list for 2016</p>

<p>Nina Caprez will lead the advanced rock climbing course `7+ climbing`, targeted to those who wish to improve their sport climbing technique.</p>

<p>Another new clinic down in the valley of Chamonix is bouldering held by Mina-Leslie Wujastyk. She will help to improve climbing and movement skills by looking at various techniques and methods.</p>

<p>After adding alpine skiing in 2015 to the list of clinics, winter sport fans can now also go and improve their skills for splitboarding. Arc´teryx athlete José Carron will lead this course and give experienced snowboarders insights into various techniques how to perform in steep skiing environments.</p>
