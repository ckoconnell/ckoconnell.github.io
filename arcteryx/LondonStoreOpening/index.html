				<p><span class="bolder">Traversing a country’s roadway can be a great way to recognize subtle but significant patterns in the landscape</span>, both human and environmental. I recently spent two weeks zig-zagging across Northern England on assignment for Lithographica, photographing rock climbing. </p>
				<p>	As the odometer climbed along the way, I noticed an interesting theme. Each time I made my way through a new township or shire, I noticed the ubiquitous dry stone walls (built in part to keep the sheep off the road) matched the buildings, that is, they employed the same kind of stone. Once at the crag, I noticed the rock matched the buildings and dry-stone-walls.</p>
				<p>This relationship was a kind of lithic tell-tale, where the built landscape gave away the specific kind of rock landscape that surrounded it, the rock that breaks from the hillside: where it outcrops, was once quarried, or falls away to the sea. In an age where it’s become desirable to think and eat locally, it was interesting to see that ‘build locally’ was the order of the day when these townships were built hundreds of year’s ago.</p>

				<h2>Surrounding the legendary slate quarry climbing of Llamberis, North Whales, were buildings and roofs made of exquisitely cut, split, and slippery slate. </h2>
				<p>It felt fitting that a country famed for it’s unique regions, distinct dialects and cultural identities, would also have a colourful spectrum of rock types and corresponding built landscape. When I asked climbers “what makes UK climbing unique and special to you”, I was always told it was the diversity of rock (then they told me about the weather). </p>
