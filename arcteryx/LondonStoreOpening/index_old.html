				<h3>We need a title and some callout about Jordan here</h3>
				<p><span class="bolder">Traversing a country’s roadway can be a great way to recognize </span> subtle but significant patterns in the landscape, both human and environmental. I recently spent two weeks with Arcteryx athletes Katy Whittaker and Mina Leslie-Wujastyk, zig-zagging across Northern England on assignment for Lithographica, photographing rock climbing.</p>
				<p>As the odometer climbed along the way, I noticed an interesting theme. Each time we made our way through a new township or shire, the ubiquitous dry stone walls (built in part to keep the sheep off the road) matched the buildings. That is, they employed the same kind of stone. Once at the crag, I noticed the rock matched the buildings and dry-stone-walls. This relationship was a kind of lithic tell-tale. It was a predictable rhythm where the built landscape inevitably gave away the specific kind of rock landscape that followed it. In an age where it’s become desirable to think and eat locally, it was interesting to see that ‘build locally’ was the order of the day when these townships were built hundreds of years ago.</p>
				<p>I found this triad relationship of climbing, built landscape, and rock everywhere we went. In North Yorkshire it was limestone. In Cheshire, sandstone. Picturesque millstones lay dormant beneath famed gritstone at Stanage Edge, obscuring any divide between human and natural landscape. Surrounding the legendary slate quarry climbing of Llamberis, North Whales, were buildings and roofs made of exquisitely cut, split, and slippery slate. On Llamberis pass, we climbed on beautiful, volcanic rhyolite. </p>

					<p>It felt fitting that a country famed for it’s unique regions, distinct dialects and cultural identities, would also have a nearly complete scale of rock types and corresponding built landscape. When I asked climbers “what makes UK climbing unique and special to you”, in a single chorus I was told it was the diversity of rock (then they told me about the unpredictable, rapidly changing weather). <span class="quoteWrap">“It’s not only diverse,”</span> native Brit Mina Leslie-Wujastyk told me, <span class="quoteWrap">“the rock is of a high quality across all the disciplines."</span></p>
					<p>That quality, and individual character of each rock-type demands a particular skill set and appeal. <span class="quoteWrap">“On grit, the climbing is usually very short, subtle, and technical, requiring the climber to have excellent body positioning and trust their feet,”</span> says Katy Whittaker about one of her favourite rock types.</p>

				<p>When the mercury dips below zero fingers go numb but friction is at it’s best to pull off of slopers. But some climbers prefer the near-frictionless slabby slate, standing on tiny edges. Others employ very strong fingers, required for crimping on limestone. On sea cliffs you may be pinching fins above the crashing waves and bobbing seals, an adventure under the gaze of the soaring fulmars.</p>
				<p>A climber who takes advantage of all this variety and becomes fluent across all of Britain’s rock — a climber like Katy Whittaker — is well-rounded climber indeed. Limestone, gritstone, slate, rhyolite, from Cornwall to Hoy. </p>
				<p>It takes a nomadic commitment. She follows the predictable, long-lived rhythm of UK rock: past old buildings, through the sheep gate in the dry stone wall, arriving at a chorus of unchanged rock: where it breaks from the hillside, was once quarried, or falls away to the sea. And the weather, for it’s part, pays no attention.</p>

				<p class="quoteMain">The climbing in the UK is unique because it is so diverse; from slate to limestone to gritstone, you can boulder, sport climb, trad climb or go deep water soloing. Not only that but the quality is high in all these disciplines.</p>
				<p class="quoteMain">I really love the sport climbing in the UK at the moment, there are some world class crags like Malham and Kilnsey but there is also the Peak limestone which is steeped in history and has a very special style to it.</p>

				<p class="quoteMain">The climbing in the UK is so rich in history and stories. The strong UK ethics over many years has lead to some of the very best trad climbing and climbers in the world.</p>
				<p class="quoteMain">I couldn't choose my favourite rock type, each has it's own unique quality that makes it special from the other. The gritstone I love for it's subtle body positioning and the trust you must have in your feet, where as the sea cliff climbing is wonderful for all the little adventures and epics you have along the way.</p>
