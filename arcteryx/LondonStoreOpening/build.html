            <h3>A Climbing Tour Through the UK's Diverse Landscapes</h3>
            <h4>Story & Photography // Jordan Manley</h4>
            <p>Traversing a country’s roadway can be a great way to recognize subtle but significant patterns in the landscape, both human and environmental. I recently spent two weeks with Arc’teryx athletes Katy Whittaker and Mina Leslie-Wujastyk, zig-zagging across Northern England on assignment for Lithographica, photographing rock climbing. </p>
            <p>As the odometer climbed along the way, I noticed an interesting theme. Each time we made our way through a new township or shire, I noticed the ubiquitous dry stone walls (built in part to keep the sheep off the road) matched the buildings. That is, they employed the same kind of stone. </p>
            <p>Once at the crag, I noticed the rock matched the buildings and stone walls. This relationship was a kind of lithic telltale. It was a predictable rhythm where the built landscape inevitably gave away the specific kind of rock landscape that followed. In an age where it has become desirable to think and eat locally, it was interesting to see that ‘build locally’ was the order of the day when these townships were built hundreds of years ago.</p>

            <p class="pullQuote">The grit has excellent friction but is quite rounded so you need to be good at holding slopers. The climbing is usually very subtle and technical. It also requires the climber to have excellent body positioning / movement and trust in their feet. It is a super solid rock, you rarely break holds off the grit. <br><br> The grit stone is renowned for having minimal gear and being scary, as the crags are so short and often gear can only be placed in low breaks (at least on the harder stuff anyway)</p>

            <p class="pullQuote">The slate has barely any friction and is usually slabby. You have to hold small edges and crimps so good finger strength is a bonus. Like the grit body positioning and movement is useful but rather than smeary footholds you have to be able to stand on tiny edges. Flexibility is pretty useful to. </p>

            <p>It felt fitting that a country famed for it’s unique regions, distinct dialects and cultural identities would also have a nearly complete scale of rock types and corresponding built landscape. When I asked climbers what makes UK climbing unique and special to you, in a single chorus I was told it was the diversity of rock (then they told me about the unpredictable, rapidly changing weather). “It’s not only diverse,” native Brit Mina Leslie-Wujastyk told me, “the rock is of a high quality across all the disciplines."</p>
            <p>That quality and individual character of each rock-type demands a particular skill set and appeal. “On grit, the climbing is usually very short, subtle, and technical, requiring the climber to have excellent body positioning and trust their feet,” says Katy Whittaker about one of her favourite rock types. When the mercury dips below zero fingers go numb, but friction is at it’s best to pull off of slopers.</p>

            <p class="pullQuote">I am not sure there is a specific type of movement or hold associated with sea cliff climbing. The trad climbing has big holds, good gear, seals in the sea and lots fulmars (the seabirds that throw up on you when you climb past). Gogarth (where we did the photoshoot) is usually quite pinchy, it has alot of 'fins' on. The sea cliff climbing is the UK is like a mini adventure day it, it is always awesome!</p>

            <p>Some climbers prefer the near-frictionless slabby slate, standing on tiny edges. Others employ very strong fingers, required for crimping on limestone. On sea cliffs you may be pinching fins above the crashing waves and bobbing seals, an adventure under the gaze of the soaring Fulmars.</p>
            <p>A climber who takes advantage of all this variety and becomes fluent across all of Britain’s rock - a climber like Katy Whittaker — is a well-rounded climber indeed. Limestone, gritstone, slate and rhyolite from Cornwall to Hoy – it takes a nomadic commitment. Katy follows the predictable, long-lived rhythm of UK rock - past old buildings, through the sheep gate in the dry stone wall, arriving at a chorus of unchanged rock where it breaks from the hillside, was once quarried, or falls away to the sea. And the weather, for it’s part, pays no attention.</p>

            <p class="pullQuote">I have not climbed much on the sandstone. It is pretty similar to grit, so impeccable technique is essential . It can vary from soft sandstone to harder. The soft stuff we would never place gear on as it would damage the rock so we would only boulder or top-rope on it, but there is hard sandstone in Northumberland.</p>

Not only that but the quality is high in all these disciplines. I really love the sport climbing in the UK at the moment, there are some world class crags like Malham and Kilnsey but there is also the Peak limestone which is steeped in history and has a very special style to it.</p>
