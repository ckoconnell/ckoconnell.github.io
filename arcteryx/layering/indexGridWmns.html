    <h1>Location Based Layering</h1>
    <p>In the winter time, we often head to the North Shore Moutains to do a quick mini-tour before work.  Here on the coast & at these lower elevations, conditons are often wet & mild.  These speedy pre-work excursions never take us above treeline & we are not out in the elements for extended periods of time.</p>
    <p>I've tried to make off season trips to South America a regular occurrence, to get some snow time in late summer / early autumn while waiting for winter to come to the northern hemisphere.  At this time of year the south is heading into spring.  A typical day can involve super warm, spring like conditions at the bottom, a long, slow, frosty chair lift ride, touring in the alpine with high sun exposure but much colder temperatures, gale force winds.  The way down of course brings the same range of conditons but in reverse order.</p>

                <p>A softshell pant with snowsports style and features. The stretchy Trusaro fabric provides ease of movement, sheds snow and water and has a level of air permeability which both sheds excess heat and protects from wind.

                <h2>Scimitar Jacket</h2>
                <p>Being the only women's jacket in Gore Tex Pro which houses a full set of ski features, this is an obvious choice.  The face fabric is soft & supple, light, easy to move in and not too crinkly. Provides weather protection in all conditions.  Ample pocketing both inside and out, a helmet compatible hood and a powder skirt which connects to the pants with a low profile snap system.  Allows for layering but eliminates excess fabric and bulk.  The Scimitar is a slightly longer length than many of our jackets which provides good body coverage and creates a flattering long & lean silhouette.</p>

                <p>The pant counterpart to the Scimitar Jacket, this is a hard wearing pant in GORE-TEXÂ® Pro.  Provides full protection from the elements, while generous side vents quickly shed excess heat while touring.  Pockets positioned on the thigh are easy to access even while wearing a longer cut shell such as the Scimitar, and are large enough to hold bulky items such as gloves, a hat etc.</p>

                <p>The main fabric is wind protective while fleece side panels are effective at shedding heat & allowing airflow through the garment to regulate temperature while on the skin track.  Soft and supple, with a cozy lining that offers some thermals during rest stops and on the descent.</p>
