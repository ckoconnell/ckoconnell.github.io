        <h1>Location Based Layering</h1>
        <p>Whether you are ski touring in the Coastal Mountains of British Columbia or the Western Alps of Europe, proper layering is crucial for regulating body temperature while shielding you from the elements. </p>
        <p>The conditions you face differ as you move around the globe in search of fresh powder and new lines. Arc’teryx Product Line Manager, Jonathan Wong has chosen a few key pieces of gear and provides a bit of insight on his approach to layering for ski touring, depending on where your search takes you.</p>
        <p>Everyone is different – some people heat up and sweat faster than others so gear choices will vary from person to person.  The below info will hopefully give you a starting-off point when researching new gear or sorting through your gear closet while packing for your next mission.</p>
        <p>Next month we'll be highlighting women's ski touring gear. Stay tuned. </p>
