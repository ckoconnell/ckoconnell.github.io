<p>Day three of Deep Winter is done an dusted.  The 5 pro photographers are no longer looking to capture their imagination in action and are now in editing mode. The goal: bring all of the moments they have captured to life in a 3-5 minute slide show to land $10,000 and the Queen/King Of Storms crown. With the 72 hour shooting window closed, it is all about the big show.</p>
<p>10 years ago the Deep Winter bar was set high when Paul Morrison was dubbed the original King Of Storms. Since then, great photographers have exploded onto the scene while legends like Paul solidified their status in the ski and snowboard world.</p>
<p>By 2pm Saturday all slideshows must be complete and submitted. Each photographer will have 30 mins to review their show on the big screen looking for any tech issues, before the crowed of 1100+ people pack the Fairmont Chateau Whistler and cheer them on. When the show begins at 8pm it will be standing room only at the Fairmont for the 10th annual Arc'teryx Deep Winter Photo Challenge!</p>
<p>To keep you in the loop here is a photo recap from Day 3 thanks to Adam and Vince who have been photographing behind the scenes as the crews race around Whistler Blackcomb.</p>
