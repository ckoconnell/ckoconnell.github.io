Deep Winter Blog Post - Pre Event (evening) - Event Preview

Deep Winter Photo Challenge 2016

The Deep Winter Photo Challenge is now in its tenth year as one of the premiere photography competitions on snow. Pitting five photographers and their athlete teams against one another, each crew will have 72 hours to shoot in and around Whistler with the hopes of taking home the crown of King or Queen of Storms.

This year, for the first time ever, teams will have one full day to venture into the Whistler's bountiful backcountry. Paired with professional guides, teams will have the chance to explore outside the resort boundaries and capture all of the natural beauty and gnarly terrain beyond the gates.

This year's teams include:
