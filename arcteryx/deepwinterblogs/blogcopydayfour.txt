Title:
Chad Chomlack Wins Deep Winter 2016

Summary:
The crown of Storms for 2016 has been bestowed upon Chad Chomlack after edging out one of the strongest fields in the events decade-long history.

Body:
After 72 hours of non-stop shooting and editing action, Saturday night provided a brief respite from the madness f or the five photographers from this year's Deep Winter Photo Challenge. With the introduction of backcountry access and ever-crazier technology at the ready, the sold out crowd at the Fairmont Chateau Whistler was treated to one of the most unique presentations in the events history.

With a mix of banger action photos tied to a compelling generational story, Chad Chomlack won the hearts and minds of both judges and the packed crowd. His $10,000 cheque left the local Whistler photographer lost for words but certainly not stoke.

The final piece of business is determining the People's Choice photo award. This is your chance to have your vote counted. Head over to whistlerblackcomb.com/deepwinter to view each photographer's choice selection for the week and help determine who will take home the final award of the week.
