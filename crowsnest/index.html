    <h1>Branding Details</h1>
    <p>You have been selected for this project based on your portfolio of previous work and as such the client is looking forward to seeing your unique perspective and style applied to the project. The client is open to any and all potential creative directions. The only limitation and/or direction available is the specific name or word mark, "Crows Nest Distillery", three words, no punctuation.</p>
    <p>The potential variety of markets that Crows Nest will be catering to necessitates a logo that can easily traverse multiple demographic segments fluidly and confidently. Ultimately, a simple design with a balance of timelessness and modernity would be the ideal. The natural aspects of the name (crows, nest) should provide a solid base from which to provide the timeless quality, the ideal would be a modern interpretation of those elements.</p>

    <h1>About The Brand</h1>
    <h3>Mission Statement</h3>
    <p>Crows Nest Distillery produces innovative hand-crafted spirits from locally-sourced ingredients, providing an authentic local alternative and outstanding value proposition to consumers of spirits mindful of supporting locally sustainable production and savouring premium quality.</p>
    <h3>The Craft Distillery Designation</h3>
    <p>Crows Nest will be approved for a distillery licence which allows for production and distribution of 50,000L of product to remain under a craft designation. Craft-designated distilleries have tax benefits but must source their main ingredients from within the province (BC), resulting in inventive solutions to ingredient sourcing.</p>
    <h3>Innovation and Competitive Points of Difference</h3>
    <p>The most exciting innovation at launch will be the unique craft rum recipe. Due to the lack of sugar cane available in the province, Crows Nest has partnered with the premier Bee Farm in the province, leveraging top quality local honey, resulting in a sweet one-of-a-kind flavour.</p>
    <p>The volume required for at-scale production will provide a significant amount of support to the agricultural honey industry in the province at a time when bee populations are at their most vulnerable, and may allow their bee supplier to increase the size of their bee farm and overall production. Crows Nest is also committed to overall sustainability efforts, and will be purchasing carbon offsets to balance production and distribution activities.</p>
    <h3>History & Current Status</h3>
    <p>The company is currently finalizing production facilities in Abbotsford, BC, and securing the equipment necessary for production at scale. Facility renovations, equipment installation and testing will begin as soon as city permitting is complete. Production is slated to begin in April-May of 2016, with distribution beginning mid-year.</p>
    <h3>Product Details</h3>
    <p>Initially, Crowsnest will be focussing on production of two product lines which will be targeting significantly varied demographics.</p>
    <li class="productDetails">
        <h3>Rum</h3>
        <p>In order to produce a craft rum without the sugar cane typically used to make the spirit, Crows Nestâ€™s Rum will utilize honey farmed locally in BC. Partnering with one of the largest honey producers in the province, this innovative new recipe has the added advantage of supporting the honeybee production ecosystem - which has seen severe turmoil of late - at a larger scale. Honey is also significantly more expensive than sugar cane, providing the consumer with a premium ingredient compared to generic mass-produced brands.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="productDetails">
        <h3>Vodka</h3>
        <p>The pioneering vodka product would be a multiple-distilled product, potentially also using honey, which would be positioned further up-market branding-wise relative to the rum, in order to compete in a much more crowded and competitive market, however it will be priced only slightly above generic mass-produced products making it attractive to customers.</p>
    </li>
    <h3>Target Market</h3>
    <p>The distillery will be catering to a potentially wide range of markets, however the focus from a marketing perspective for the rum product will be on the 19-31 year old demographic with a priority placed on 21-25 year-olds, while the vodka product will range from 19-50, strategically partnering with local tastemakers and tasteplaces in an effort to foster awareness organically.</p>
    <p>Brand appeal will need to be broad due to the variations in potential market positioning. Although the brand will not necessarily be competing with premium labels with regard to price, the creative should allow for it to be dressed up and toned down, allowing most of the visual focus to be put on the individual product brands and their stories, which are to be developed as soon as this branding project is completed.</p>
    <h3>Positioning</h3>
    <p>Initial projections for both the Rum and Vodka products have pricing estimated at $24 per bottle retail as opposed to $20-22 for the standard market brands like Bacardi/Captain Morgan or Smirnoff/Absolut, but still well below the premium and other craft brands priced at $35-40 and higher. This pricing strategy will allow the brand to skew to the younger demographic whose aspirational tastes can often be out of sync with their actual resources. The creative should be sympathetic to this dynamic.</p>
    <h3>Brands We Like</h3>
    <p>Throughout the initial planning and discussion stages, Absolut has time and again been regarded very highly for their branding strategy: a strong creative presence with a design simple enough to be seamlessly integrated into everything from event-specific one-offs like Pride-celebration rainbow-wrapped-bottles to their up-market premium offerings with full-colour graphical screens and glass etchings.</p>
    <p>Locally, while there are several distilleries that produce high quality product, the branding and creative aspects of our provincial competitors leaves much to be desired. This poses a significant opportunity to present the brand in an impactful, globally relevant manner.</p>
