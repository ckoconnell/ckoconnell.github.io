      <p>Good day NetMotion Team,</p>
      <p>Hope this message finds you well. My name is Chris O'Connell and I would love to be considered for your open Digital Designer position. I've been living in Victoria for the past couple of years and have been working freelance while seeking an oppourtunity to join a solid team with which I could be a good fit.</p>
      <p>My skillset and work experience is quite vast and varied, something that is not always seen as an asset, but I believe in this case much of what I've done aligns with your requirements and it sounds like I could be a good compliment to your efforts.</p>
      <p>At my core, I'm a passionate content creator. I've been fortunate to have had the ability to practice across many fields and mediums: web design and development, graphic design, photography, video editing and filming, live streaming production, event support & management and even a stint in print in editor and photo editor roles. Most recently I've been diving into the 3D content creation pipeline, developing photoscanning workflows and exploring potential commercial applications.</p>
      <p>With regards to your specific desirables, I believe I can address everything. On the technical side, I'm familiar with all of the software mentioned and am an expert across the Adobe Suite - though I have been working towards an open source workflow of late. My freelance work these days consists mostly of web design and development so I can provide functional, responsive designs with production ready markup and CSS for my layouts. </p>
      <p>Additionally, my extensive content and editorial experience has provided valuable skills with respect to developing a brand's voice as storytelling has become such an integral part of marketing. I'm in a unique position to be able to take these considerations into account throughout the creative and technical processes. If you're looking for someone that can develop an overall brand vision while executing hands on tasks like style guide creation, I'm fully up for the challenge.</p>
      <p>If you'd like to learn more about my work experience and recent projects I have a page linked below, as well as one that showcases a variety of my visual work.</p>
      <p>Thank you for your time and consideration and please don't hesitate to let me know if there's any other information, samples of work, etc. that I can provide.</p>
			<p>Have a great day,</p>
			<p>Chris</p>
