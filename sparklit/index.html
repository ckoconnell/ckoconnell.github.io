      <p>Good Day SparkLIT Team,</p>
			<p>I've come across your posting for a Front End Web Developer and would love to be considered for the role. I've recently moved to Victoria and while currently continuing my freelance work am looking to find a good fit with a solid team.</p>
			<p>My skillset and experience is quite varied and spans several disciplines related to digital content creation and development - everything from web work for top tier brands and projects to producing live webcasts from the side of a mountain. I've worked happily as a lone wolf and as part of a team and strive to be as proactive as possible with regards to progress on ideas and processes.</p>
			<p>With specifc regards to the web development requirements for this role, my position at Arc'teryx in Vancouver would be the most relevant. My main duties supporting campaigns on arcteryx.com involved working within an MVC framework, utilzing Grunt for our builds, Git for version control, and SASS as our preprocessor. Additionally, I supported the content and social team with new WordPress based sites for their blog and Academy event series. </p>
			<p>I've included a link below to an overview of my work experience and recent projects. Please let me know if there's any other information or relevant samples of work that would be of interest. Or if you'd just like to chat about why SASS is so much better than LESS, that's cool too.</p>
			<p>Thank you for your time and consideration and have a great day,</p>
			<p>Chris</p>
