      <p>Good day Number team,</p>
			<p>Hope this message finds you well. My name is Chris O'Connell and I would love to be considered for your open Graphic & Web Designer position. I'm a fairly recent transplant to Victoria - just under a year now - and have been seeking an oppourtunity to join a solid team with which I could be a good fit. </p>
			<p>My skillset and work experience is quite vast and varied, something that is not always seen as an asset, but I believe in this case much of what I've done aligns with your requirements and it sounds like I could be a good compliment to the team.</p>
			<p>At my core, I'm a passionate content creator. I've been fortunate to have had the ability to practice across many fields and mediums: web design and development, graphic design, photography, video editing and filming, live streaming production, event support & management and even a stint in print in editor and photo editor roles. Most recently I've been losing myself down the seemingly infinite rabbit-holes that are the 3D content creation pipeline. Game changing possibilities, but a lot to learn.</p>
			<p>With regards to your specific desirables, I believe I can address everything. On the technical side, I'm familiar with all of the software mentioned and am an expert across the Adobe Suite - though my After Effects skills are admittedly not as good as my Blender chops. My freelance work these days consists mostly of web design and development so I can provide functional, responsive designs with production ready markup and CSS for my layouts. I live in Google Sheets, I track everything religiously. I shoot photos and video and have been mixing in 3D rendering of late. </p>
			<p>Beyond that, I'm very much at home working with brands to modernize, launch or revamp specific initiatives or entire organizations. I enjoy the oppourtunity to provide input and feedback on macro level strategy and planning, but need to get my hands dirty and produce at the end of the day. </p>
			<p>It sounds like we might be on the same page. I am very encouraged by your mention of dedicated project managers - it's such an important role and having the right people can make all the difference. If you'd like to learn more about my work experience and recent projects I have a page linked below, as well as one that showcases a bit of my visual work. </p>
			<p>Thank you for your time and consideration and please don't hesitate to let me know if there's any other information, samples of work, etc. that I can provide. </p>
			<p>Have a great day,</p>
			<p>Chris</p>
