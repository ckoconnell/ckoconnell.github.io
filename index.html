	<h1>Content Department Notes</h1>
	<h3></h3>

<section class="bodycopy">
	<p>George, below are my notes on structuring a digital content department within the current Arc'teryx infrastructure. I've tried to keep the theoretical stuff to a minimum and attempted to put everything in the context moving forward within our current situation.</p>
	<p>It should be said that while I believe I have a pretty good understanding of how things are currently structured, I apologize in advance if any of my assumptions below are off base.</p>
	<p>Thanks for the oppourtunity to share my thoughts. I have quite a bit more written so if you need any further information please let me know.</p>

	<h1>Overall Goals</h1>
	<ul>
		<li class="goals">Ensure the content that is produced is of a quality representative of the brand's market position</li>
		<li class="goals">Develop and implement a modern Digital Asset Management program</li>
		<li class="goals">Provide support to internal stakeholders and maximize consumer exposure to all of the awesome stuff we do.</li>
	</ul>
	<h1>Departmental Structure</h1>
	<p>Overall, our current structure is producing great results for the business, but there are some shortcomings. The ideal outcome in my opinion is to avoid tinkering with processes and teams that are working well, molding the new content team to fill in gaps where they currently exist in addition to pushing forward with stepping up the quality, volume, and relevance of our digital content efforts.</p>
	<p>I would propose the following structure:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<dl>
				<dt>Web</dt>
				<dd>Responsible for Arcteryx.com, Veilance, all ecomm related activities, and QA/Testing</dd>
				<dd>This would be comprised of the current web team with John Wooton and John Housser leading the design and technical direction of the company as is currently the case.</dd>
				<dd>Web would also provide high level support for the needs of the Content team such as initial setup of servers and act as a go-between for IS and the digital department </dd>
				<dd>Management of all product related content, seasonal launches, new product programs</dd>
				<dd>Merchandising</dd>
			</dl>
		</li>
		<li>
			<dl>
				<dt>Product Content</dt>
				<dd>- All product related content processes will continue to live with Jo as she has a very good track record of delivering on time, dealing with current roadblocks, and working towards making these tasks more efficient.</dd>
			</dl>
		</li>
		<li>
			<dl>
				<dt>Digital Campaign Marketing</dt>
				<dd>- Responsible for all campaign related materials, including email and digital ad campaigns.</dd>
				<dd>- We have a good workflow here, so just as above with the web team, my feeling is that if it's not broken don't fix it.</dd>
			</dl>
		</li>
		<li>
			<dl>
				<dt>Social Media</dt>
				<dd>- Responsible for maintaining all social media feeds</dd>
				<dd>- Work with the content team to disseminate content across platforms and channels</dd>
				<dd>- Focus on engagement with the end consumer and ensuring that Digital Marketing, Content and Web efforts have maximum exposure.</dd>
				<dd>- Down the road as we expand our online efforts, the social team could be expanded to incorporate an element of live customer service</dd>
			</dl>
		</li>
		<li>
			<dl class="extraBottom">
				<dt>Content </dt>
				<dd>- The new content team would be responsible for properties outside of the main business/ecomm focus of the web team and be completely separate from product content activities.</dd>
				<dd>- Digital Asset Management infrastructure - Creation and management of all digital assets accessible to all internal stakeholders in the company.</dd>
				<dd>- Responsible for the blog, event support and coverage, and special one-off projects such as store sites, internal tools ie sales meeting site, and our contest programs.</dd>
				<dd>- Non-core-business features of the main websites, such as Athlete pages, event listings, one-off campaign asset</dd>
				<dd>- Planning, production, and execution of all non-product-related content activities.</dd>
			</dl>
		</li>	
	</ul>


	<h1>Resourcing </h1>
	<p>Properly resourcing content efforts has traditionally been difficult - these are generally new programs that may not fit nicely within legacy corporate structures. But with digital we have a couple of advantages that can help: </p>
	<p>The first of which is the Cost of Reach. The production and dissemination of a single piece of content across all of our platforms is going to be the most cost effective communication medium we have, period. And while it's not an apples to apples comparison with say the amount spent to service an existing customer within our warranty program, the potential audience and customer gain upside of content efforts should be very hard to ignore, even for the most traditional of corporate structures.</p>
	<p>The second is the oppourtunity for these content efforts to product revenue on their own merit. Print advertising, paid digital campaigns, and other traditional marketing programs are set costs. Content on the other hand can be flexible, and given appropriate quality can actually generate revenue through page/media views and cross platform partnerships with external content delivery networks. The ability for content to support itself is something that should not be overlooked (see Salomon FreeskiTV). </p>

	<h1>The People</h1>
	<p>There are two ways to go about staffing our content program: The first is more traditional - filling roles specific to certain tasks and operating much the way we do now. This has the advantage of fitting in to our current structure more seamlessly, but would cost significantly more and take longer to ramp up as we would need to staff each need and task separately. </p>
	<p>My suggestion would be a newer more flexible approach whereby we look for people with varied skill sets so that the department can scale more organically and we end up with a team of mulit-talented individuals that can function alone if need be, or as part of a team environment where circumstances allow.</p>
	<p>This new approach is also a better way of fitting into the 24 hour content cycle. You can see the current difference in workflow between our web and social teams at the moment. The social and content worlds are not 9-5 roles and we need to ensure that the team is comprised of people that are experienced in the field or willing to be flexible enough to get the job done regardless of details like what time of the day it is or whether or not something fits into a traditional â€˜job description'. </p>
	<p>These new hires should have multidisciplinary talents and be able to work autonomously to produce and deliver content. Currently we should be looking for people with the following aptitudes:</p>

	<ul>
		<li class="skills">Web Development</li>
		<li class="skills">Copy Writing & Editing</li>
		<li class="skills">Photography</li>
		<li class="skills">Videography and Editing </li>
		<li class="skills">Audio Expertise</li>
		<li class="skills">Front-of-camera/voice talent</li>
		<li class="skills">Bonus:</li>
		<li class="skills">Established Athlete Relationships</li>
		<li class="skills">Experience in traditional media environments</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Realistically, t's not going to be possible to find a full team of people that have all of these skills, but if we focus on ensuring that everyone coming on board has competency in at least two, ideally three of these skills, we will be well on the way towards building a very flexible team with the ability to produce in the most efficient manner possible.</p>
	<p>To best illustrate the advantages of this strategy we can look at some of the shortcomings we've had in my experience up to this point, and how a new structure (and more resources in general) can help.</p>

	<dl class="example">
		<dt><strong>Issue:</strong> Redbull Ines Project Video </dt>
		<dd>This was the case where Redbull was willing to share the video they created for the failed Ines Project of climbing the peaks around the Eiger in Switzerland.</dd>
		<dd><strong>Outcome:</strong> Due to our inability to move resources to this in a timely manner we did not take advantage of the potential upsides of getting this out on the home page. Resources were wasted in the preparation of these assets with no follow through.</dd>
		<dd><strong>Solution:</strong> The content team would have the skills to process and upload the video to all of our channels and also the experience to provide code for implementation on arcteryx.com for the web team or the ability to post it themselves. They would have the skills to provide copy for dissemination across social channels and would provide any needed support to the social team for implementation.</dd>
	</dl>

	<dl class="example extraBottom">
		<dt><strong>Issue:</strong> Squamish Mountain Festival</dt>
		<dd>One of our four key events for the year, there was a lack of content posted during and after the event. This can be particularly damaging to brand reputations when pre-event promotion and hype is strong but doesn't result in any pay off for those not actually attending the event in person.</dd>
		<dd><strong>Outcome:</strong> One full month after the event there's very little in the way of content to show our consumers, and the website has not been updated to communicate the event is over and to stay tuned for details on next year's version.</dd>
		<dd><strong>Solution:</strong> One of the most important functions of the content team will be this type of content gathering and event coverage. Dependant on the resources available, one or more content team members would be at the event live, producing content across as many channels as possible. With a team of varying skill sets we'd be able to push content through at least two mediums (copy, photos, and/or video for example, or perhaps audio interviews with a dynamic slideshow). </dd>
	</dl>

	<h1>Content Department Responsibilities Overview</h1>
	<p>To elaborate further on the tasks that the Content team would be responsible for, I've made some more detailed notes below. I believe that more clearly defining ownership of various tasks will foster more creative outcomes and minimize instances where lack of attention to detail has resulted in more work for everyone involved along the process.</p>
	<dl class="spacing extraBottom">
		<dt class="topPad">Content & Digital Asset Management & Infrastructure</dt>
		<dd>A huge part of the initial content team build will need to be the creation of content infrastructure. These are the systems and processes that are developed in order to make the content creation and distribution workflow as efficient and flexible as possible, and building in redundancies to deal with in-the-field issues.</dd>
		<dd>This is also where ensuring that the team has development chops is so important. Removing the roadblock currently associated with getting non-core development done through the web, we would be able to move with much more agility.</dd>
		<dt class="topPad">Blog</dt>
		<dd>The blog would be repositioned as an aggregator for activity for the brand. Currently our channels and efforts are far too fragmented. We must realize that the majority of our customers are not engaged across every single channel we publish to, and that we could do a better job of ensuring that quality content is given the exposure it warrants. The goal would be to incorporate all relevant digital content activity in one place, the challenge is doing so while maintaining the clean user experience that we value internally.</dd>
		<dt class="topPad">Events</dt>
		<dd>The content team would be responsible for all event related tasks, including site builds and coverage during and after events. They would ensure that digital event properties flow smoothly through four phases: Event Lead Up & Promotion, Live Event Coverage, Wrap-up, and Off-Season.</dd>
		<dt class="topPad">Special Projects</dt>
		<dd>Whereas the traditional Web team will be dealing with regular development and maintenance, the content team can step in and help with special projects. Things like the yearly "Best Of" would be a perfect example of this type of project. This allows the Web team to focus on deadlines and core business functionality while providing resources where currently we're lacking.</dd>
		<dt class="topPad">Athletes</dt>
		<dd>Working with the marketing team, the Content team would take a leadership role in telling our athletes stories. </dd>
	</dl>

	<h1>The Way Forward</h1>
	<p>Regardless of what shape the new Content team takes, the way forward should include the following in order to ensure that we're solving problems with each new step and avoiding creating new ones:</p>
	<dl class="spacing">
		<dt class="topPad">Content Audit</dt>
		<dd>Complete a full review of our digital content efforts (non-product) and identify strengths & weaknesses.</dd>
		<dt class="topPad">Internal Stakeholder Consultation</dt>
		<dd>Meet with the various departments internally to solidify issues that need to be addressed.</dd>	
		<dt class="topPad">Strategic Planning & Initial Resource Hiring </dt>
		<dd>Meet with the various departments internally to solidify issues that need to be addressed.</dd>
		<dt class="topPad">Digital Asset Management </dt>
		<dd>The creation and management of current and past digital assets. Organizing data up to this point is going to be a massive undertaking.</dd>
		<dt class="topPad">Clean Up </dt>
		<dd>As a way for the new team to get comfortable they will be tasked with fixing any and all items identified in the initial Content Audit.</dd>
		<dt class="topPad">Content Relaunch</dt>
		<dd>With new processes in place and new resources available, the content department will relaunch the blog as a property more aligned with all of the content related activities of the company. </dd>
		<dt class="topPad">Go Time </dt>
		<dd>At this point the only limit is the ideas we come up with - we're well setup to produce and deliver content and it's full steam ahead.</dd>
