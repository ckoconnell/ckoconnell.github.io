	<p>George, below are my notes on structuring a digital content department within the current Arc’teryx infrastructure. I’ve tried to keep the theoretical stuff to a minimum and attempted to put everything in the context moving forward within our current situation.</p>
	<p>It should be said that while I believe I have a pretty good understanding of how things are currently structured, I apologize in advance if any of my assumptions below are off base.</p>
	<p>Thanks for the oppourtunity to share my thoughts. I have quite a bit more written so if you need any further information please let me know.</p>

	<h1>Overall Goals</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>Ensure the content that is produced is of a quality representative of the brand’s market position</li>
		<li>Develop and implement a modern Digital Asset Management program</li>
		<li>Provide support to internal stakeholders and maximize consumer exposure to all of the awesome stuff we do.</li>
	</ul>
	<h1>Departmental Structure</h1>
	<p>Overall, our current structure is producing great results for the business, but there are some shortcomings. The ideal outcome in my opinion is to avoid tinkering with processes and teams that are working well, molding the new content team to fill in gaps where they currently exist in addition to pushing forward with stepping up the quality, volume, and relevance of our digital content efforts.</p>
	<p>I would propose the following structure:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<dl>
				<dt>Web</dt>
				<dd>Responsible for Arcteryx.com, Veilance, all ecomm related activities, and QA/Testing</dd>
				<dd>This would be comprised of the current web team with John Wooton and John Housser leading the design and technical direction of the company as is currently the case.</dd>
				<dd>Web would also provide high level support for the needs of the Content team such as initial setup of servers and act as a go-between for IS and the digital department </dd>
				<dd>Management of all product related content, seasonal launches, new product programs</dd>
				<dd>Merchandising</dd>
			</dl>
		</li>
		<li>
			<dl>
				<dt>Product Content</dt>
				<dd></dd>
			</dl>
		</li>
		<li>
			<dl>
				<dt>Digital Campaign Marketing</dt>
				<dd></dd>
				<dd></dd>
				<dd></dd>
			</dl>
		</li>
		<li>
			<dl>
				<dt>Social Media</dt>
				<dd></dd>
				<dd></dd>
				<dd></dd>
				<dd></dd>
			</dl>
		</li>
		<li>
			<dl>
				<dt>Content </dt>
				<dd></dd>
				<dd></dd>
				<dd></dd>
				<dd></dd>
				<dd></dd>
			</dl>
		</li>	
	</ul>
