	<h1>Content Department Notes</h1>

	<p>George, below are my notes on structuring a digital content department within the current Arc’teryx infrastructure. I’ve tried to keep the theoretical stuff to a minimum and attempted to put everything in the context moving forward within our current situation.</p>
	<p>It should be said that while I believe I have a pretty good understanding of how things are currently structured, I apologize in advance if any of my assumptions below are off base.</p>
	<p>Thanks for the oppourtunity to share my thoughts. I have quite a bit more written so if you need any further information please let me know.</p>

	<h1>Overall Goals</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>Ensure the content that is produced is of a quality representative of the brand’s market position</li>
		<li>Develop and implement a modern Digital Asset Management program</li>
		<li>Provide support to internal stakeholders and maximize consumer exposure to all of the awesome stuff we do.</li>
	</ul>
	<h1>Departmental Structure</h1>
	<p>Overall, our current structure is producing great results for the business, but there are some shortcomings. The ideal outcome in my opinion is to avoid tinkering with processes and teams that are working well, molding the new content team to fill in gaps where they currently exist in addition to pushing forward with stepping up the quality, volume, and relevance of our digital content efforts.</p>
	<p>I would propose the following structure:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<dl>
				<dt>Web</dt>
				<dd>Responsible for Arcteryx.com, Veilance, all ecomm related activities, and QA/Testing</dd>
				<dd>This would be comprised of the current web team with John Wooton and John Housser leading the design and technical direction of the company as is currently the case.</dd>
				<dd>Web would also provide high level support for the needs of the Content team such as initial setup of servers and act as a go-between for IS and the digital department </dd>
				<dd>Management of all product related content, seasonal launches, new product programs</dd>
				<dd>Merchandising</dd>
			</dl>
		</li>
		<li>
			<dl>
				<dt>Product Content</dt>
				<dd>- All product related content processes will continue to live with Jo as she has a very good track record of delivering on time, dealing with current roadblocks, and working towards making these tasks more efficient.</dd>
			</dl>
		</li>
		<li>
			<dl>
				<dt>Digital Campaign Marketing</dt>
				<dd>- Responsible for all campaign related materials, including email and digital ad campaigns.</dd>
				<dd>- We have a good workflow here, so just as above with the web team, my feeling is that if it’s not broken don’t fix it.</dd>
			</dl>
		</li>
		<li>
			<dl>
				<dt>Social Media</dt>
				<dd>- Responsible for maintaining all social media feeds</dd>
				<dd>- Work with the content team to disseminate content across platforms and channels</dd>
				<dd>- Focus on engagement with the end consumer and ensuring that Digital Marketing, Content and Web efforts have maximum exposure.</dd>
				<dd>- Down the road as we expand our online efforts, the social team could be expanded to incorporate an element of live customer service</dd>
			</dl>
		</li>
		<li>
			<dl>
				<dt>Content </dt>
				<dd>- The new content team would be responsible for properties outside of the main business/ecomm focus of the web team and be completely separate from product content activities.</dd>
				<dd>- Digital Asset Management infrastructure - Creation and management of all digital assets accessible to all internal stakeholders in the company.</dd>
				<dd>- Responsible for the blog, event support and coverage, and special one-off projects such as store sites, internal tools ie sales meeting site, and our contest programs.</dd>
				<dd>- Non-core-business features of the main websites, such as Athlete pages, event listings, one-off campaign asset</dd>
				<dd>- Planning, production, and execution of all non-product-related content activities.</dd>
			</dl>
		</li>	
	</ul>


	<h1>Resourcing </h1>
	<p>Properly resourcing content efforts has traditionally been difficult - these are generally new programs that may not fit nicely within legacy corporate structures. But with digital we have a couple of advantages that can help: </p>
	<p>The first of which is the Cost of Reach. The production and dissemination of a single piece of content across all of our platforms is going to be the most cost effective communication medium we have, period. And while it’s not an apples to apples comparison with say the amount spent to service an existing customer within our warranty program, the potential audience and customer gain upside of content efforts should be very hard to ignore, even for the most traditional of corporate structures.</p>
	<p>The second is the oppourtunity for these content efforts to product revenue on their own merit. Print advertising, paid digital campaigns, and other traditional marketing programs are set costs. Content on the other hand can be flexible, and given appropriate quality can actually generate revenue through page/media views and cross platform partnerships with external content delivery networks. The ability for content to support itself is something that should not be overlooked (see Salomon FreeskiTV). </p>

	<h1>The People</h1>

	<p>There are two ways to go about staffing our content program: The first is more traditional - filling roles specific to certain tasks and operating much the way we do now. This has the advantage of fitting in to our current structure more seamlessly, but would cost significantly more and take longer to ramp up as we would need to staff each need and task separately. </p>
	<p>My suggestion would be a newer more flexible approach whereby we look for people with varied skill sets so that the department can scale more organically and we end up with a team of mulit-talented individuals that can function alone if need be, or as part of a team environment where circumstances allow.</p>
	<p>This new approach is also a better way of fitting into the 24 hour content cycle. You can see the current difference in workflow between our web and social teams at the moment. The social and content worlds are not 9-5 roles and we need to ensure that the team is comprised of people that are experienced in the field or willing to be flexible enough to get the job done regardless of details like what time of the day it is or whether or not something fits into a traditional ‘job description’. </p>
	<p>These new hires should have multidisciplinary talents and be able to work autonomously to produce and deliver content. Currently we should be looking for people with the following aptitudes:</p>
