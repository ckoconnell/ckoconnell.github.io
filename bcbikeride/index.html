			<p>The globally recognized and iconic logo of the BC Bike Race is affectionately named B.O.B., which stands for ‘Bear On Bike.’   BOB has been the proud symbol for BC Bike Race for 10 years.  <img src="http://www.bcbikerace.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/logofinal.png">			
 In his 11th year, BOB is on the move and starting to roam…. and he is heading way up North!        You see BOB loves BC singletrack and his standards are extremely high for both trails and customer service. We’re being cheeky here, but what you can expect at BCBR – RACE or RIDE – is endless BC singletrack and excellent service.  That’s what BOB represents to us and we adhere to his standards. Our Goal at BCBR is to provide a mountain bike event-style adventure that rivals or exceeds ‘the best week of your life.’  </p>

			<p><span class="bolder">What’s the difference between BC Bike RACE and BC Bike RIDE?</span><br/> At our RACE things are a bit more structured.  You are being timed on a set course that everyone follows and drives the ambitious goal of becoming an official BC Bike Race Finisher. In any race, you typically would not ‘session’ a feature or re-ride a trail that you really liked – time is of the essence and you must keep going!     But at BC BIKE RIDE, you will have that freedom. <span class="bolder">It’s about exploration on your own terms and about picking your own adventure each day</span>.   We get you there and show you the way, but YOU get to choose how, what, and how much you want to ride.   There will be recommended routes, detailed maps, local guides, and shuttles to get to the trails.    XC, Epic, DH,  Enduro, freeride, dirt jumping – in BC, we just call it all ‘mountain biking’.  <span class="bolder">However you define your individual riding style, you will enjoy this adventure on your terms</span>.</p>

			<h1 class="highlight">ITINERARY</h1>
			<p>In early August, the days are long up North and our goal at BC Bike RIDE is to max out each day with as much fun as humanly possible, right until the last embers of the campfire burn out.   Together, we will be a nomadic tribe of fun loving mountain bikers exploring the great Northern Corridor trails of Williams Lake, Prince George, Burns Lake, Smithers, and Terrace with a bonus ride on the famous North Shore of Vancouver to kick off your week. </p>

			<p>Northern BC lies within the territories of a stunning diversity of Indigenous Nations who have lived on and cared for the land since time immemorial.  The BC Bike Ride will pass through the lands of numerous Nations including the Tsilhqot’in, Secwepemc, Nazco, Lheidli T’enneh, Carrier Sekani, Wet’suwet’en, Gitxsan, and Tsimshian.  We strive to create experiences that are respectful and acknowledge the First Nations upon whose territories we ride.  The <span class="bolder">BC Bike RIDE</span> will include unique opportunities to experience and learn about Indigenous culture, heritage, and gain a deeper understanding and appreciation of their history and spiritual connections to the land.</p>
