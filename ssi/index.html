      <p>Good Day SSI Team,</p>
			<p>I've come across your posting for a Website and Graphic Designer and would love to be considered for the role. I'm a somewhat recent translpant to Victoria and have been looking for a good fit with a solid team while I continue my freelance work.</p>
      <p>As a digital content producer I've developed a varied skillset that spans several disciplines relevant to the goals you've outlined. From web design & development to digital asset creation and brand development, I'm in a unique position to be able to strategize, plan and execute with a holistic viewpoint that ensures consistency across channels both digital and analog.</p>
      <p>SSI looks like an incredibly interesting company with a product that's well established, highly valued and well supported. The oppourtunity to develop and showcase a more authentic brand identity - something less reliant on third-party and stock assets - would be right in my wheelhouse.</p>
      <p>I've included a link below to an overview of my work experience and recent projects. Please let me know if there's any other information or relevant samples of work that might be of interest.</p>
      <p>Thank you for your time and consideration and have a great day,</p>
			<p>Chris</p>
