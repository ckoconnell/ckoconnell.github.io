      <p>Good Day Cordova Bay Team,</p>
      <p>My name is Chris O'Connell and I would love to be considered for your Marketing Coordinator position. I have over a decade of experience across all things digital content & marketing and have been referred to as a 'digital Swiss Army knife'. It sounds like you're looking for someone that can provide support across multiple disciplines and I'm confident I could fill that role.</p>
      <p>I'm equally comfortable organizing and executing behind the scenes as I am on the ground supporting live events as they unfold. Additionally, my extensive experience with web design and development may also be of use to your team. </p>
      <p>With regards to the music space, my experience includes production management of the entertainment aspect for IF3, a freeskiing film festival in Montreal, where I not only coordinated shows for artists like Kid Koala (Club Soda) and Cali P (Telus Theatre) but also simultaneosly produced live webcasts of the performances.</p>
      <p>As a fan, my interests span several genres from electronic (Ninja Tune is a favourite label of mine) to the Motown and oldies that my parents indoctrinated me with growing up. I'm always on the search for new sounds and try to support artists at live shows as much as possible.</p>
      <p>I've linked to my resume below which outlines my work experience and recent projects. If you'd like any further information or samples of my work please do let me know, I'd be happy to prepare anything you feel is relevant.</p>
      <p>Thank your for your consideration and have a great day,</p>
      <p>Chris</p>
