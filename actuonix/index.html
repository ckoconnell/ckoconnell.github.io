      <p>Good Day Actuonix Team,</p>
			<p>I've come across your posting for a SEO & Marketing Specialist and would love to be considered for the role. I'm a somewhat recent transplant to Victoria and have been continuing my freelance work while looking for a good fit with the right team.</p>
			<p>As a digital content producer with well over a decade of experience across a variety of roles and mediums, I may actually have the skill set to fulfull all of the requirements outlined. With regards to the core marketing tasks, I've planned and exectued multi-channel campaigns of almost all sizes and complexities - from working on Arc'teryx's $40M digital business all the way to simple, single channel efforts for local businesses. </p>
			<p>Additionally I do have experience with Google Adwords, social media marketing, Amazon and E-Commerce integrations, video/photo/3D visual asset creation across digital and print, editorial/branded content creation, and campaign & market analysis. That's a lot to cover in an introductory letter so please let me know if you'd like specifics on any or all of these items.</p>
			<p>And while I am certainly not in the class of engineer or rocket scientist, I do have an aptitude for technology and have been more than willing to learn where necessary. Most relevant to this role, I successfully built a Prusia i3 3D Printer from parts including all wiring, firmware, software, etc., though I won't pretend it was finished in a record setting time.</p>
			<p>This sounds like a great oppourtunity and I'd love to chat further if you think I might be a fit. Below is a link to a page outlining my work exprience and some recent projects. Please do let me know if you'd like me to address my experience in more depth or provide additional samples of specific work.</p>
      <p>Thank you for your time and consideration and have a great day,</p>
			<p>Chris</p>
